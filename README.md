# DER Twin

Digital Twin infrastructure for modern energy systems.

**DER Twin** is a lightweight simulator for Distributed Energy Resources (DER) — BESS, PV inverters, CHP units, energy meters, and grid models — exposed via Modbus TCP and Modbus RTU. Use it for EMS development, protocol testing, integration validation, and control algorithm sandboxing without touching real hardware.

---

## ⚡ Quickstart

### Option A — pip install

```bash
pip install dertwin
```

Bring your own site config and register maps:

```bash
dertwin -c path/to/your/config.json
```

You should see:
```
INFO | Building site: my-site
INFO | Starting Modbus TCP server | 0.0.0.0:55001 | unit=1
INFO | Simulation engine started | step=0.100s
```

The simulator is now accepting Modbus TCP connections on the ports defined in your config.

### Option B — Run from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlexSpivak/dertwin.git
cd dertwin
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
python -m dertwin.main -c configs/simple_config.json
```

### Option C — Run with Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlexSpivak/dertwin.git
cd dertwin
python generate_compose.py configs/simple_config.json
docker compose up --build
```

`generate_compose.py` reads the config and generates a `docker-compose.yml` with the correct ports automatically. No manual port configuration needed. For mixed-protocol configs with RTU, see [Docker with RTU](#docker-with-rtu) below.

---

## 🔌 Connect an EMS

With the simulator running, start the example EMS from a second terminal:

```bash
cd examples
python main_simple.py
```

You'll see the EMS connecting over Modbus and cycling the BESS between 40–60% SOC:

```
[EMS] Connected to BESS
[EMS] Starting in CHARGE mode
[EMS] STATUS=1 | SOC= 42.30% | P=  -20.00 kW | MODE=charge
[EMS] STATUS=1 | SOC= 44.10% | P=  -20.00 kW | MODE=charge
...
[EMS] Reached 60% → switching to DISCHARGE
```

For a full multi-device site (dual BESS + PV + CHP + energy meter + external models):

```bash
python -m dertwin.main -c configs/full_site_config.json
# in another terminal:
python examples/main_full.py
```

You'll see the CHP go through its realistic startup sequence (~2 minutes) before reaching `RUNNING` and dispatching power, while the BESS units cycle and the energy meter aggregates the full site balance.

For a mixed-protocol site (BESS on TCP + PV and meter on RTU), see [Mixed Protocol Example](#-mixed-protocol-example-tcp--rtu) below.

---

## 🔁 Dynamic Asset Membership

In addition to config-driven site definitions, DERTwin's `SiteController` supports adding and removing assets at runtime. Use this for scenario scripts ("at t=300s, a new PV inverter comes online"), live demos, and EMS-driven sites where the asset roster is decided by an external controller.

```python
from dertwin.controllers.site_controller import SiteController
import asyncio

# Build an empty site
site = SiteController({
    "site_name": "demo",
    "step": 0.1,
    "real_time": True,
    "register_map_root": "configs/register_maps",
    "assets": [],
})
site.build()
asyncio.create_task(site.start())

# Add an asset live — protocol server starts immediately, site power model picks it up next tick
await site.add_asset({
    "asset_id": "bess-01",
    "type": "bess",
    "ip": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 55001,
    "unit_id": 1,
    "capacity_kwh": 200.0,
    "initial_soc": 50.0,
})

# ...later, remove it
await site.remove_asset("bess-01")
```

Key properties:
- The site power model captures device lists by reference, so dynamically added generators show up in the energy meter's grid balance on the next tick — no rebuild required.
- `add_asset` is idempotent: re-registering an existing `asset_id` is a no-op.
- `remove_asset` cancels the protocol task and shuts down the server cleanly; the engine keeps running for the remaining assets.
- See [`dertwin/controllers/README.md`](dertwin/controllers/README.md) for the full API and the two supported configuration shapes (legacy `protocols: [...]` for multi-protocol use, flat spec for single-TCP-endpoint runtime use).

## ⚙️ Configuration

Sites are defined in JSON. Each asset declares its type, parameters, and protocol bindings:

```json
{
  "site_name": "my-site",
  "step": 0.1,
  "real_time": true,
  "start_time_h": 12.0,
  "register_map_root": "register_maps",
  "external_models": {
    "irradiance": { "peak": 1000.0, "sunrise": 6.0, "sunset": 18.0 },
    "grid_frequency": { "nominal_hz": 50.0, "noise_std": 0.002, "seed": 42 }
  },
  "assets": [
    {
      "type": "bess",
      "capacity_kwh": 100.0,
      "initial_soc": 60.0,
      "protocols": [{ "kind": "modbus_tcp", "ip": "0.0.0.0", "port": 55001, "unit_id": 1, "register_map": "bess_modbus.yaml" }]
    },
    {
      "type": "chp",
      "rated_kw": 4000.0,
      "heat_to_power_ratio": 1.0,
      "min_load_percent": 30.0,
      "max_load_percent": 110.0,
      "protocols": [{ "kind": "modbus_tcp", "ip": "0.0.0.0", "port": 55002, "unit_id": 1, "register_map": "chp_modbus.yaml" }]
    }
  ]
}
```

**`real_time: true`** — engine runs its own loop, use for `dertwin` CLI and EMS examples
**`real_time: false`** — caller drives the clock via `step_once()`, use for tests
**`start_time_h`** — sets simulation clock on startup (e.g. `12.0` for noon). All external models start from this time.
**`register_map_root`** — path to register map directory, resolved relative to the working directory where you run `dertwin`
**`ip: "0.0.0.0"`** — required when running inside Docker so port mapping works. Use `127.0.0.1` for local-only.

### Supported asset types

| `type` | Class | Notable parameters |
|---|---|---|
| `bess` | `BESSSimulator` | `capacity_kwh`, `initial_soc`, `max_charge_kw`, `max_discharge_kw`, `ramp_rate_kw_per_s` |
| `inverter` | `PVSimulator` | `rated_kw`, `module_efficiency`, `area_m2` |
| `chp` | `CHPSimulator` | `rated_kw`, `heat_to_power_ratio`, `min_load_percent`, `max_load_percent` |
| `energy_meter` | `EnergyMeterSimulator` | (no parameters — observes the site power model) |

### Protocol Configuration

Each asset's `protocols` array supports both Modbus TCP and Modbus RTU. A single device can expose multiple protocols simultaneously.

**Modbus TCP:**
```json
{ "kind": "modbus_tcp", "ip": "0.0.0.0", "port": 55001, "unit_id": 1, "register_map": "bess_modbus.yaml" }
```

**Modbus RTU:**
```json
{ "kind": "modbus_rtu", "port": "/tmp/dertwin_device", "baudrate": 9600, "parity": "N", "stopbits": 1, "unit_id": 1, "register_map": "bess_modbus.yaml" }
```

RTU parameters `baudrate`, `parity`, `stopbits`, `bytesize`, and `timeout` all have sensible defaults (9600/N/1/8/1.0) and can be omitted.

**Register map fields:**

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | Human-readable label, used in logs and the EMS client |
| `internal_name` | yes | Maps to the device's internal telemetry or command field — must match the attribute name in the corresponding telemetry class (see [`dertwin/telemetry/README.md`](dertwin/telemetry/README.md)) |
| `address` | yes | Modbus register address (0–65535) |
| `type` | yes | `uint16`, `int16`, `uint32`, `int32` |
| `scale` | yes | Multiplier applied on read, divisor applied on write |
| `count` | yes | Number of registers (1 for 16-bit, 2 for 32-bit) |
| `func` | yes | Function code: `0x02` discrete input read, `0x03` holding read, `0x04` input read, `0x06` single write, `0x10` multi-register write |
| `direction` | yes | `read` or `write` |
| `endian` | no | `big` (default) or `little` — for devices like Sungrow BESS and Carlo Gavazzi meters that use little-endian 32-bit register layout |
| `unit` | no | Physical unit label (V, kW, Hz, etc.) |
| `description` | no | Free-text note |
| `options` | no | Enum mapping for status/mode registers |

`name` and `internal_name` can differ — `name` is what the EMS client sees, `internal_name` is what the device simulator uses internally. For example, `on_grid_power_setpoint` (name) maps to `active_power_setpoint` (internal_name) on the BESS device.

For detailed architecture and per-package docs, see [`dertwin/README.md`](dertwin/README.md).

## 🔀 Mixed Protocol Example (TCP + RTU)

This example runs a site with BESS on Modbus TCP and PV + energy meter on Modbus RTU. The EMS controls the BESS over TCP and monitors the RTU devices for observability.

### Prerequisites

Install `socat` to create virtual serial port pairs:

```bash
# macOS
brew install socat

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install socat
```

### Running the example

**Terminal 1** — create virtual serial pairs and start the simulator:

```bash
# Create virtual serial port pairs (simulator <-> EMS client)
socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0,link=/tmp/dertwin_pv pty,raw,echo=0,link=/tmp/dertwin_pv_client &
socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0,link=/tmp/dertwin_meter pty,raw,echo=0,link=/tmp/dertwin_meter_client &

# Start the simulator (from repo root)
dertwin -c configs/mixed_protocol_config.json
```

You should see:
```
INFO | Building site: mixed-protocol-site
INFO | Starting Modbus TCP server | 0.0.0.0:55001 | unit=1
INFO | Starting Modbus RTU server | port=/tmp/dertwin_pv | baudrate=9600 | unit=1
INFO | Starting Modbus RTU server | port=/tmp/dertwin_meter | baudrate=9600 | unit=1
INFO | Simulation engine started | step=0.100s
```

**Terminal 2** — run the mixed-protocol EMS:

```bash
cd examples
python main_mixed.py
```

Expected output:
```
[BESS-1] TCP connected
[PV] RTU connected
[METER] RTU connected
[BESS-1] Starting in CHARGE mode

[EMS] Mixed-protocol EMS running
  [BESS-1] RUN  | SOC= 50.0% | P= -30.00 kW | MODE=charge
  [PV]    P= 16.40 kW (producing)
  [METER] Grid= +23.57 kW (importing) | Freq=50.000 Hz | Import=0.1 kWh | Export=0.0 kWh
```

The key point: socat creates a **pair** of linked pseudo-terminals for each connection. The simulator opens one end (`/tmp/dertwin_pv`) and the EMS client opens the other (`/tmp/dertwin_pv_client`). Both sides must use different ends of the pair.

If RTU serial ports are unavailable, the EMS will still run with BESS-only control — PV and meter telemetry will show as unavailable.

---

## 🐳 Docker

### TCP-only configs

For configs that only use Modbus TCP, Docker setup is straightforward:

```bash
python generate_compose.py configs/full_site_config.json
docker compose up --build
```

TCP ports are mapped automatically from the config. Connect your EMS to `localhost:<port>`.

### Docker with RTU

RTU serial devices use pseudo-terminals (`/dev/pts/`) which exist only inside the container's kernel namespace and can't be accessed from the host via volume mounts. The entrypoint solves this by bridging each RTU serial port to a TCP port inside the container using a Python asyncio relay. From the host, `socat` converts the TCP connection back into a local PTY that the EMS opens as a normal serial port.

**Step 1** — generate the compose file and start the container:

```bash
python generate_compose.py configs/mixed_protocol_config.json
docker compose up --build
```

You should see:
```
[entrypoint] Creating serial pair: /tmp/dertwin_pv <-> /tmp/dertwin_pv_bridge
[entrypoint] Bridging /tmp/dertwin_pv_bridge -> TCP port 56001
[bridge] /tmp/dertwin_pv_bridge <-> TCP :56001
[entrypoint] Creating serial pair: /tmp/dertwin_meter <-> /tmp/dertwin_meter_bridge
[entrypoint] Bridging /tmp/dertwin_meter_bridge -> TCP port 56002
[bridge] /tmp/dertwin_meter_bridge <-> TCP :56002
[entrypoint] RTU bridges ready
[entrypoint] Starting DERTwin simulator
INFO | Starting Modbus TCP server | 0.0.0.0:55001 | unit=1
INFO | Starting Modbus RTU server | port=/tmp/dertwin_pv | baudrate=9600 | unit=1
INFO | Starting Modbus RTU server | port=/tmp/dertwin_meter | baudrate=9600 | unit=1
```

`generate_compose.py` detects RTU ports in the config and automatically exposes the bridge TCP ports (56001, 56002, ...) alongside the regular Modbus TCP ports in the generated `docker-compose.yml`.

**Step 2** — in a separate terminal on the host, create local PTY endpoints (requires `socat`):

```bash
socat pty,raw,echo=0,link=/tmp/dertwin_pv_client tcp:localhost:56001 &
socat pty,raw,echo=0,link=/tmp/dertwin_meter_client tcp:localhost:56002 &
```

This creates `/tmp/dertwin_pv_client` and `/tmp/dertwin_meter_client` on the host — the same paths the EMS expects.

**Step 3** — run the EMS (same command as the local setup):

```bash
cd examples
python main_mixed.py
```

The EMS uses the exact same config for both local and Docker setups — the serial paths (`/tmp/dertwin_pv_client`, `/tmp/dertwin_meter_client`) are identical. The only difference is how those paths are created: locally via direct socat pairs, or via Docker with TCP bridging.

### Override config at runtime

```bash
docker run \
  -v /path/to/my/configs:/app/configs:ro \
  -e CONFIG_PATH=/app/configs/my_site.json \
  -p 55001:55001 \
  dertwin-simulator
```
